PDO is good. But if you was use the MySQLi, you will feels like crazy. Because it is so simple.

If you was use NoSQL like a MongoDB, always want to object, class or function to do database operations.

I am making possible to use database operations by class. In this repository, I'm going to show you how to use database operations by functions of class rather than to use PDO directly.


``` php
var foo = function (bar) {
  return bar++;
};

```
